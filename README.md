# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
We were tasked to create a Supervised Machine Learning Model that could accurately predict credit risk. We wanted to look at several factors using our loan_stats.csv file to help predict whether somebody might qualify as high or low risk status.  In order to determine credit risk factors amongst our data set, we used the following methods:

  1. Naive Random Oversampling
  2. SMOTE Oversampling
  3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
  4. SMOTEENN Sampling
  5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
  6. Easy Ensemble Classifying

## Results
